# Pacman_Exercise
A JavaScript exercise to keep the Pacman moving along the x-axis and reverse trajectory once the Pacman hits the edge of the screen on the x-axis.

## Description
* This is an exercise from the MIT|XPro - Professional Certificate for Coding
* My tasks in this exercies were to
  * update the starter code with setInterval() or setTimeout() and 
  * to add screen dection to the Pacman animation so it reverses direction after hitting the edge.

## How to Run
You may clone this repo to your local machine and make any modification as you like. Have fun! 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
* add pacman's movement on y-axis as it hits the horizontal edge
* add walls inside the box and have the pacmen turn a random direction when hit a wall
* add a button (create pacman) to create more pacmen as we click the button
